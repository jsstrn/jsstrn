# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jesstern Rays and I am a software engineer. 

I write clean, maintainable code through test-driven development.

When I'm not hunched over the computer, you can find me going on long walks, perfecting my downward dog, cycling along the beach, or kayaking in mangroves.
