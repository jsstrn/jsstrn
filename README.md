# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jesstern Rays. I'm a software engineer and live in the tropical paradise that is Singapore.

I enjoy playing nostalgic retro games on my RetroPie cause everything is better in 8 bit. I also enjoy chess quite a bit.

When I'm not hunched over the computer, you can find me going on long walks in nature, perfecting my warrior pose, cycling along the beach, or kayaking in the dense mangroves.
