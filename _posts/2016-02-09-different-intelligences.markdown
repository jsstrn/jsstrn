In this video by Big Think, Howard Gardner talks about the different types of intelligences that people have. The first two, linguistic intelligence and mathematical intelligence, are what traditional standardized tests valorize.

0. **Linguistic intelligence** is the ability to use language. A skill which writers, poets, journalists, and orators possess.

0. **Logic and mathematical intelligence** is typically found in mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. Such professions require you to perform mathematical proofs, scientific reasoning, experimentations and the like.

0. **Musical intelligence** is the ability to appreciate different kinds of music and to produce music by voice or instruments. Unsurprisingly, we find this in musicians, composers, singers, and songwriters.

0. **Spatial intelligence** can be seen in fighter pilots and race car drivers allowing them to maneuver skillfully in the sky or on the race track at high speeds. In the video, Howard Gardner mentions chess players have spatial intelligence, but I wonder if theirs is not more of pattern recognition. Or perhaps pattern recognition is a type of spatial intelligence.

0. **Bodily kinesthetic intelligence** can be seen in dancers and athletes, but also in craftsmen.

0. **Interpersonal intelligence** is the ability to understand others. A person with this intelligence is able to work well with others and to lead them.

0. **Intrapersonal intelligence** is the ability to understand yourself. A person with this intelligence is able to introspect and examine ones own emotional state and mental processes.

In the video, Howard Gardner goes on to list a few more intelligences, including **naturalist intelligence**, **teaching intelligence**, and **existential intelligence**.
